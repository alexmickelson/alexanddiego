                    Welcome to FileHub! Your alternative to conventional cloud storage! FileHub started as a final project for our Web Development class
		    but ended being a greater learning experience that we ever expected. We transformed the static look of the webpage, to an (almost) fully working
		    storage place for users to store and retrieve files at all times. Right now it's still under development, but we hope to make out of this website, an alternative
		    for family and friends to store their files easily. We still have a lot to do, but we're working on it!<br><br>
